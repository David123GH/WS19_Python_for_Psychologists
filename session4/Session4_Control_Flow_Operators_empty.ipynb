    "    # different\n",

    "- the if-part AND the else-part (called an **if-else-statement**)\n",
    "- all parts (called an **if-elif-else-statement**)\n",
    "\n",
    "The *indenation* is, by the way, SUPER important. It tells Python the starting and ending point of each part of the if-statement. For example, after the \"else\"-part is done, we should continue to write our code on the same level as \"if\", \"elif\" and \"else\" and not on the level of the code parts between them. Otherwise Python will think that the code is still part of the things that should be executed in the \"else\" case.\n",
