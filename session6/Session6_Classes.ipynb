    "Of course, the concept of classes is nothing new. Basically, classes are categories of objects. In everyday life we are familiar with classes/categories for objects like \"cars\" or \"buildings\" or \"dogs\". The reason for the categorization of these object is that they all share common features. For example, cars are usually used as means of transportation and, hence, we can drive them and also use their break. At the same time, they also have certain features that vary between them, like their colour. Of course, every car *has* a colour, but what specific colour it is will vary from one car to another. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classes and instances\n",
    "In programming, classes are used to describe objects and to define what one can do with them and what other kind of features they have. Each object/\"exemplar\" of a class is called an **instance**, and the creation of an instance is, hence, called instantiation. The following code part shows the instantiation of an object of class list:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "instance_of_class_list = []\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This should look pretty familiar. Each time we create a new object, e.g., a list, we create a new instance of the class \"list\". We can check the class of an object by using the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "instance_of_class_list.__class__ # this would return \"list\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, we can check if an object is an instance of a certain class using the `isinstance()` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "isinstance(my_object, some_class) # returns True or False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of classes and instances is the core of *object oriented programming*, a programming style that aims at designing code in a way that it represents/resembles structures of the real world domain/phenomenon. Python is not exclusively an object oriented programming language but it supports it and several things are implemented in an OOP fashion. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods and attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes have two types of feautures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1) Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods describe what one can do with this kind of objects, that is, methods describe *functions* that are associated with each instance of the class. Usually, they are the same for different instances of a class. Methods can be used/applied to an object like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "some_instance.some_method()\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will run the respective method/function with respective to the object. We have already met list methods like `.pop()` and `.remove()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**2) Attributes**\n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes describe variable features that are not functions. Attributes can be variable across different instances of a class. Attributes can be accessed like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "some_instance.some_attribute\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see the syntax is the same as the one for methods, *except for the parentheses ( )*. We have also met and used some attributes, e.g., the `.columns` attribute of pandas data frames."
